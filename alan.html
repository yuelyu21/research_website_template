<h3 id=statistical>Investigate the geospatial pattern of LAN in US counties from 2012 to 2019</h3>
<p>Over the past century, global nightscapes have been drastically changed by the rapid growth of electric lighting. It has been estimated that ALAN has been growing by 5-20% annually in many urban areas since the mid-20th century. A more recent analysis using new data gathered by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day-Night Band (VIIRS DNB) reported that not only did the total lit areas (defined as radiance>5 nWcm−2 sr−1) expand considerably around the globe between 2012 and 2016, brightness levels in areas that were already continuously lit increased by 2.2% per year during this period.  According to one estimate, more than 99% of the U.S. population now live in areas with light-polluted skies.  Although electric lighting has tremendous benefits, including promoting commerce activities, enhancing social interactions and improving public safety, these benefits are also accompanied by serious ecological, economical and public health consequences.</p>
